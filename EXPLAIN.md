# Link Sentinel - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

Link Sentinel is a comprehensive web application security analyzer built with a Flask backend and HTML/JavaScript frontend. The application performs multi-layered security analysis of URLs through several specialized components.

## Core Components

### 1. Link Analyzer (`link_analyzer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes URL legitimacy and security concerns
- **Key Features**:
  - URL validation and format checking
  - Domain age verification through WHOIS
  - SSL certificate validation and analysis
  - TLD risk assessment (high/medium/low risk categories)
  - Redirect chain analysis
  - Security header verification
  - Risk score calculation based on multiple factors

### 2. DNS Inspector (`dns_inspector.py`)
- **Purpose**: Performs comprehensive DNS analysis
- **Key Features**:
  - A/AAAA record verification
  - MX record analysis
  - NS record validation
  - TXT record inspection
  - WHOIS information retrieval
  - DNSSEC configuration checking
  - DNS security scoring and recommendations

### 3. Shodan Scanner (`shodan_scanner.py`)
- **Purpose**: Gathers server intelligence and vulnerability information
- **Key Features**:
  - Port scanning and service identification
  - Vulnerability detection and classification
  - SSL/TLS certificate analysis
  - Technology stack identification
  - Service misconfiguration detection
  - Server exposure scoring
  - Security recommendations generation

### 4. Report Generator (`report_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Aggregates analysis results and generates comprehensive reports
- **Key Features**:
  - Trusted domain verification
  - Suspicious pattern detection
  - Weighted risk score calculation
  - Security issue categorization
  - Recommendation prioritization
  - Detailed analysis summary generation

## Analysis Process

1. **URL Submission**
   - User submits URL through web interface
   - Backend validates URL format

2. **Multi-layered Analysis**
   - Link Analyzer performs initial URL and SSL analysis
   - DNS Inspector checks domain configuration
   - Shodan Scanner gathers server intelligence
   - Each component generates component-specific scores

3. **Report Generation**
   - Report Generator aggregates all analysis results
   - Calculates overall risk score with weighted components
   - Categorizes security issues by severity
   - Generates prioritized recommendations
   - Produces final verdict and confidence level

4. **Result Presentation**
   - Frontend displays comprehensive analysis
   - Shows overall security score
   - Lists critical issues and key findings
   - Provides detailed recommendations

## Security Scoring

### Component Weights
- Browser Analysis: 40%
- DNS Analysis: 20%
- Link Analysis: 20%
- Server Analysis: 20%

### Risk Levels
- Safe: < 20 points
- Low Risk: 20-40 points
- Medium Risk: 40-60 points
- High Risk: 60-80 points
- Critical Risk: > 80 points

### Score Adjustments
- Trusted domains receive more lenient scoring
- Suspicious patterns on trusted domains incur penalties
- Critical security issues have higher weight
- Missing security headers affect overall score

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep vulnerability databases current
   - Update trusted domain lists
   - Maintain suspicious pattern definitions

2. **API Key Security**
   - Secure storage of Shodan API key
   - Regular key rotation
   - Rate limit monitoring

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when services fail
   - Timeout management for external services
   - Comprehensive error logging

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Asynchronous analysis execution
   - Efficient DNS resolution
   - Caching of frequent lookups
   - Resource usage monitoring

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask web framework
- Shodan API access
- DNS resolution capabilities
- SSL verification tools
